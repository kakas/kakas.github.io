今天想開一個新專案的時候，一直出現 `Could not verify the SSL certificate`，如下：

```shell
run  bundle install
Fetching source index from https://rubygems.org/

There is a chance you are experiencing a man-in-the-middle attack, but most likely your system doesn't have the CA certificates needed for verification. For information about OpenSSL certificates, see http://bit.ly/ruby-ssl. To connect without using SSL, edit your Gemfile sources and change 'https' to 'http'.

爬了一整天的文都找不到解法，乾脆把所有的 openssl 全部砍掉重裝，結果就正常了，囧

1. `$ brew uninstall --force openssl`
2. `$ brew install openssl`
